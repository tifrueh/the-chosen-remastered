So let me tell about your Quest: You must find the legendary Swords of Dusk and Dawn in order to kill the Demon King and thus finally end his cruel reign and free the land from the clutches of his demons. Fare thee well!",

An-Harat blocks your first thrust with ease and starts a vicious counterattack, aiming for your throat. The Sword of Dusk sweeps up, deflecting An-Harat's blade. But he keeps his balance and comes at you again. He pushes you back with a series of incredibly fast attacks, and you have to step back a few paces, all while blocking his slashes with both your swords. A shallow cut appears on your arm, seeping blood. Doubt enters your mind. Can you truly defeat this beast? You feel the swords in your hands becoming warmer and strength floods back into your tired arms. You push away all thoughts and launch an attack yourself. You lunge towards your enemy, the Sword of Dawn reaching for An-Harat's chest. He blocks your thrust, but you turn around and fight on, faster and faster, until your eyes can barely see your blades anymore. You feel your foe tiring, each of his moves becoming slower and less controlled. Finally, you spot an opening in An-Harat's defense and move in for the kill. The Sword of Dawn sinks into the Demon King's chest, his sword clatters to the ground, and you look into his eyes, their fire slowly fading.";

That must be where the unbearable stench is coming from.";

The walls are ornately decorated and in the middle of the room you see a long table with many wooden chairs to each side of it. It seems as if someone was preparing a feast, for the table is set with many plates and cutlery. The only thing missing is the food.";

On these shelves are trophies of polished gold, so many that you have to close your eyes first to get accustomed to the gleaming golden light they reflect. The only real light source is a lantern hanging in the middle of the ceiling.";

You can also see a hearth fitted into the north wall. A fire has been carefully built, but not yet ignited. The only light is coming from a lantern standing on the table.";
