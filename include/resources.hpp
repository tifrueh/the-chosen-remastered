An-Harat blocks your first thrust with ease and starts a vicious counterattack, aiming for your throat. The Sword of Dusk sweeps up, deflecting An-Harat's blade. But he keeps his balance and comes at you again. He pushes you back with a series of incredibly fast attacks, and you have to step back a few paces, all while blocking his slashes with both your swords. A shallow cut appears on your arm, seeping blood. Doubt enters your mind. Can you truly defeat this beast? You feel the swords in your hands becoming warmer and strength floods back into your tired arms. You push away all thoughts and launch an attack yourself. You lunge towards your enemy, the Sword of Dawn reaching for An-Harat's chest. He blocks your thrust, but you turn around and fight on, faster and faster, until your eyes can barely see your blades anymore. You feel your foe tiring, each of his moves becoming slower and less controlled. Finally, you spot an opening in An-Harat's defense and move in for the kill. The Sword of Dawn sinks into the Demon King's chest, his sword clatters to the ground, and you look into his eyes, their fire slowly fading.";
