The walls are ornately decorated and in the middle of the room you see a long table with many wooden chairs to each side of it. It seems as if someone was preparing a feast, for the table is set with many plates and cutlery. The only thing missing is the food.";

My demons certainly were no challenge for you, for you are in the possession of the legendary Swords of Dusk and Dawn, is that not so? Even as powerful a servant as Mandrak would not have been able to withstand those dreadful blades of yours, the bringers of death and destruction. Are you here to kill me, then? Do you want to take my throne? You want to take my world from me, because you think it belongs to you mortals? You want to end my eternal reign and rid the world of my kind? Come on then, try to ban me from my realm, try to destroy my immortal soul with these weapons you carry, and I'll behead you right where you stand!",

The Sword of Dusk sweeps up, deflecting An-Harat's blade. But he keeps his balance and comes at you again. He pushes you back with a series of incredibly fast attacks, and you have to step back a few paces, all while blocking his slashes with both your swords. A shallow cut appears on your arm, seeping blood. Doubt enters your mind. Can you truly defeat this beast? You feel the swords in your hands becoming warmer and strength floods back into your tired arms. You push away all thoughts and launch an attack yourself. You lunge towards your enemy, the Sword of Dawn reaching for An-Harat's chest. He blocks your thrust, but you turn around and fight on, faster and faster, until your eyes can barely see your blades anymore. You feel your foe tiring, each of his moves becoming slower and less controlled. Finally, you spot an opening in An-Harat's defense and move in for the kill. The Sword of Dawn sinks into the Demon King's chest, his sword clatters to the ground, and you look into his eyes, their fire slowly fading.";
